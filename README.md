Blokie is a powerful AI/engine/solver for [Blockudoku](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.easybrain.block.puzzle.games), [Woodoku](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tripledot.woodoku&hl=en_CA&gl=US), and [Block Sudoku](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=block.puzzle.sudoku.free.game.classic.offline) puzzle games. It can achieve 1.5 million points (roughly 40,000 sets of 3 pieces) on average.

## What can I learn from Blokie to improve at the game?

### Prioritize clearing
Blokie will clear blocks almost every round. If your board is clean, there is almost always a way to clear, so look *very* hard before deciding to let blocks stack up. 

### Plan your 3 pieces together
Blokie sees placing each set of 3 pieces as one move, rather than 3 individual moves. This lets it plan tricky clearing patterns and leave a clean board state. Try to visualize where you will place all 3 pieces before you place your first piece.

When Blokie plays with only 2 pieces at a time, rather than 3, it's average score drops by over 98%.

### Rules of thumb for keeping your board clean
Blokie's most critical component is its "board cleaniness" measurement. Roughly speaking in decreasing importance:
  - Minimize the number of blocks on the board.
  - Minimize the total perimeter of blocks.
  - Avoid jagged edges of blocks.
  - Avoid leaving a single empty space between two blocks.
  - Keep as many 3x3 cubes free as possible.

## Implementation details
Blokie looks at all possible board states resulting from places the 3 pieces and chooses the the move that results in the best "board cleaniness" score.

Internally, the board state is represented as a bitboard using three 32-bit integers.

The board state evaluation weights were trained using a genetic learning algorithm written in C++. JavaScript is too slow for training.

## Can I have the computer play for me?
No.
